# e2e_chat

To run the server, run the `index.js` in the root directory.

The client was made with `create-react-app` and exists in the `e2e_client` directory.

## Purpose

Most end-to-end platforms sacrifice anonymity for security. This is meant to be a solution that allows for the most anonymous group communication possible. No messages are saved or cached on the server side (similar to IRC). This combined with HTTPS and RSA encryption makes for an extremely secure system for communication.
